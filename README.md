# PyScript BoilerPlate

<center><img src="./images/icon.png" height="100"></center>

I have been taking a look into PyScript recently for some of my personal projects and the only thing that has been very grueling for me is to write the boiler plate everytime by copying it from the official website. 

https://pyscript.net/

So, in order to make my life easy, i have compiled this extension which is going to help you quickstart with the boilerplate which can be updated as you move forward.

This repo contains the codebase of the same extension. 

There are two ways to configuring this. The first option will allow you to configure the snippet by yourself and for yourself only. While, the other way is to make it available for everyone. 

1. Configuring using `User Snippets`.
2. Configuring it as an extension.
